## Setup

We are working with ggplot here. Base is nice. Plotly is also nice. But for now 
we are almost exclusively sticking with ggplot2.

Besides ggplot2, we are working with other libraries to extend the functionality
of ggplot or access interesting data.

Therefore: Install the following libraries:

~~~
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("cowplot")
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
install.packages("ggExtra")
~~~
{: .language-r}

And load them:


~~~
library(tidyverse)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──
✔ dplyr     1.1.2     ✔ readr     2.1.4
✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0
✔ ggplot2   3.4.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1
✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0
✔ purrr     1.0.1     
── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
ℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
library(cowplot)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

Attaching package: 'cowplot'

The following object is masked from 'package:lubridate':

    stamp
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
library(palmerpenguins)
~~~
{: .language-r}


There, done!
