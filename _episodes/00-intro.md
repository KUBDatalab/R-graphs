## What is this?

This is a collection of graphs and plots, primarily made with ggplot2.

It contains notes on what a given type of plot is, what it is usually used
for, how to make it, interesting variations, and pitfalls one should be 
aware of using it.


## What is it not?

This is not a course. We use this as reference for part of the work we do
in KUB Datalab, and as supplemental material in certain courses. 

It is also not a statistics page. We show (when we get around to actually doing
it), how to make a survival plot. But how the data behind such a plot is not
something we get into. 

## What is here?
Plots are organised by their use. For each type of plot, there are notes on
what it is, what it is typically used for, how we make them, some interesting
variations on the major theme (if there are any. Or if we can imagine them.).
And notes on common pitfalls, mistakes and errors using this particular plot.

## What is missing?

Send us an email on kubdatalab@kb.dk or, better, report an issue on 
https://github.com/KUBDatalab/R-graphs/issues if you spot a mistake, 
have a favorite plot we have not included, or are frustrated because we have
not finished the description of a particular plot type that you need now!
